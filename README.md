- Python 3.9
- Machine learning
- üè¶ Industrial Use Cases

## Models Used
* Linear Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* K-Neighbors Regressor
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBRegressor
* CatBoosting Regressor
* AdaBoost Regressor

From these above models after hyperparameter optimization we selected Top two models which were XGBRegressor and Random Forest Regressors and used the following in Pipeline.

* GridSearchCV is used for Hyperparameter Optimization in the pipeline.

* Any modification has to be done in  Inside Config.yaml which can be done in route **/update_model_config**

## `carprice` is the main package folder which contains 

**Artifact** : Stores all artifacts created from running the application

**Components** : Contains all components of Machine Learning Project
- DataIngestion
- DataValidation
- DataTransformations
- ModelTrainer
- ModelEvaluation
- ModelPusher

**Custom Logger and Exceptions** are used in the Project for better debugging purposes.

## Conclusion
- This Project can be used in real-life by Users or Used car dealers to predict the Estimated Price of the car based on input specifications.
